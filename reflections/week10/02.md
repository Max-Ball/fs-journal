## Questions

1. What is a List in C#?

A list is a generic type that you can use to create a list of any type. 

2. What List methods seem like you might use them often? Why?

List.Find seems like a method I would use a lot. Being able to return a property within a list by find seems important.

3. How would you retrieve an item from a list? What method could you use?

You could use almost any of the find methods.

This lab helped me understand C# a lot more. Being able to use the CRUD methods and use the same patterns that we've already been taught helped a lot.
