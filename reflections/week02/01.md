1. What is Scope ?

Scope is where variables are available for use. Globally scoped variables are declared outside of a function. Locally scoped variables are declared inside a function.


2. What is Hoisting ?

Hoisting is a a JavaScript mechanism that variables and function declarations inherently have that allow them to move to the top of their scope before the code gets executed.
