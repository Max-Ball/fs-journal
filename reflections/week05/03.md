## Questions

1. In simple terms what is timeboxing?

Timeboxing is a time management technique that sets specific amounts of time for each task.

2. What three strategies will you implement and how?

The two-minute rule will be utilized by responding to immediate needs only if it takes two minutes or less. Being flexible will allow me to change gears on the timebox if that task was initially underestimated. The last strategy is knowing my golden hour - which is usually after dinner for me.

3. Give an example of when you would have benefitted from timeboxing and how? 

Timeboxing seems like a tool that is beneficial to adopt both within the workspace and in day to day life. I could use timeboxing during a weekend day of chores.
