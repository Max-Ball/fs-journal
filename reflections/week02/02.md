## Questions

1. What are the three ways to syntactically write a function? What are the differences in how the function acts (if any)?

Function declarations are created by using the function keyword followed by the name. Function declarations are hoisted. Function expressions are not hoisted, so they cannot be used before they have been defined. Arrow function expressions are the last way a a function can be written. They do not create their own 'this' value. 

2. What is the difference between Parameters and Arguments?

Parameters are used when defining a function. They are the names created in the function definition. Arguments are the values that the function receives from each parameter when invoking the function. 

3. What are higher order functions? Can you provide an example?

Higher order functions are when one function accepts another function as a parameter, or returns a function. array.filter() and array.find() are examples of higher-order functions.

Today's assignment was both frustrating and rewarding. I was able to add extra functions that made the game and the process of making the game more fun. Using the forEach and filter both seem extremely versatile and important.
