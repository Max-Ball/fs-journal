## Questions

1. What is the purpose of wire-framing? 

Wire-framing is a tool used to plot out the basic ideas and layout of a website or app. 

2. What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?

There are three levels of wire-framing. Low-fidelity, Mid-fidelity, and High-fidelity. Low fidelity is the most basic foundation of layout. Mid-fidelity is the most popular and will introduce design elements like font sizes while still leaving out more specific elements of the design. High-fidelity wire-frames should layout a complete design of the website or app. These wire-frames should include all specific details. 

3. Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?

Wire-frames do seem like an incredibly important process to making a page. It's much easier to think of the bigger picture ahead of time and use the wire-frame as a template, than trying to build the code and brainstorm at the same time.
