## Questions

Write a review and reflection of your experiences in this course, as this is the last lecture before your `final project`, what are your concerns, how do you plan to manage your time, what have you enjoyed most about the course up to this point.

This course has been such a great experience. To look back at what I've learned and how far I've come within the software development field is really amazing. I couldn't be more excited to enter this field as a junior developer and I think this course, regardless of how short it was, has prepared me to get into this field.
