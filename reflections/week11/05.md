# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts

This final has already been a blast to work on. I was able to finish the back end on Friday and have been able to focus on the front end now. I am very thankful that I completed the AllSpice checkpoint as that has been a great reference for me.
