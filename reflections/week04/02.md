## Questions

1. What are the three states of a `Promise`?

Pending: It is the initial state, before the outcome of either resolved or rejected.
Resolved: Completed promise
Rejected: Failed promise

2. How do `promise`s seek to resolve the issues of "callback hell"?

Promises seek to resolve callback hell by using chaining. Chaining is when we attach callbacks to promises, instead of passing them.

3. What is the difference between `.then()` and `.catch()`?

.then() is only used for resolved promises. It is called after the promise is resolved.

.catch() is used for rejected promises. Very similar to an if/else.
