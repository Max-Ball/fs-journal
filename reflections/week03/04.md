> **ðŸ“– [The Observer Pattern](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk3/04-Observer-Pattern)**

## Questions

1. What problems does the Observer Pattern seek to solve?

The observer pattern seeks to solve the issue of keeping many elements synced with the same data.

2. What are the three mechanisms of the observer pattern?

The Subscribe Method to add new events, the Unsubscribe Method to remove events, and the Broadcast Method to call all events. 

3. Review the code generated from the bcw-template and reflect on the proxy objects from yesterday, and your understanding of the observer pattern today. With this knowledge, explain how the magic of the bcw-template uses these two concepts to manage and update the dom.

The use of ProxyState.on acts in the same manner as the observer pattern. They both reduce redundant code and make the code more efficient.
