## Questions

1. What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use

Pseudo-Classes give you the ability to style an element based on it's reaction to outside factors.

Some common ones I'm sure I'll be using are:

:hover

:visited

:before/:after

:root


2. What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?

Specificity determines which rule gets applied if there are multiple rules that have different values, but target the same element.

3. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?

When you over-utilize the !important feature you run the risk of creating too many specific style declaration that will override other declarations.
