## Questions

1. What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide?

Unit Testing - Unit tests allow you to test individual units of code in isolation

Component Testing - Allows you to test while also providing Vue-specific conveniences

End-to-End Testing - Allows you to test what happens when users actually use your application

2. What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?

End-to-End Testing seems the most beneficial towards the end of development, but Unit testing seems the most beneficial throughout all development phases.

3. What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?

The component testing seems the least useful because from what I understand these tests can be done with the other testing methods to some degree.
