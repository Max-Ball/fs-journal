## Questions

1. What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style.

Using return is helpful when dealing with truthy/falsy statement. And using console.log() is a great way to test anything else



2. Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?

The Elements Tab lets you see the HTML/CSS code. This is helpful when debugging because you're able to click each line to see and see what part is affecting the DOM in a buggy way.

3. Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code?

Using the JS debugging pane i.e. 'debugger' is a more time efficient way to debug your code when you can't immediately resolve the issue.
