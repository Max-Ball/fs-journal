# Sprint Retrospective

## Reflect on your partner project and answer the following questions

1. Which principles from this weeks reading did you implement?

For the checkpoint I tried to take into account the UX and how to display my page to direct users around the site. 

2. What went well this week?
The server side for me went surprisingly well. I thought after having a couple of weeks not writing server side I would have a hard time refreshing what I know, but I was able to get the server side done with relative ease.


3. What would you do differently?

If I was to do this checkpoint over again I would probably work on styling in a different way. I ended up liking the end result, but I started trying various style themes before realizing what I really wanted to do.
