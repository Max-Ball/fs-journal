## Questions

1. What are the three categories of data types? How are they different?

Value Type - It holds data within its own memory space

Reference Type - A reference doesn't store its value directly.

Pointer Type - No conversions exist between these types, but you can convert between different pointer types and between pointer types and integral types. 

2. What are the Value-type data types? What differences do you notice from JavaScript?

bool      enum      short
byte      float     struct
char      int       uint
decimal   long      ulong
double    sbyte     ushort

The difference between javascript is that C# has a lot more value types for numbers. 

3. In your own words how do Reference types get stored in memory? How does this differ from Value types?

Reference types store an address that points to where the value is stored whereas value types store the data within its own memory.
