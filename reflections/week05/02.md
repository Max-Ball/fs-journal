## Questions

1. What are the three types of relationships?

One to one
One to many
Many to many

2. What are the benefits of the traditional `linking` of relationships instead of `Embedding`

Linking will not grow the original document, so it is less likely that the application will run into the max document size of 16mb. It's also easier to return paginated items so the speed time of document retrieval is less.

3. What are some of the challenges faced when deciding how to manage a many-to-many relationship that ultimately drive your decision on how to create it?

Challenges arise when figuring out what the maximum size of N and M are going to be. If the max size of N is only 4, but the max size of M is 4000 - one way embedding or even third collection embedding will work. If the max size of N and M are a closer ratio, for instance 4:3, then two way embedding will probably work better.
