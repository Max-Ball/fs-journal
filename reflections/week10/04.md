## Questions

1. What is an Enum, and what are some use cases for them?

Enums are strongly typed constants. You could use enums when you want to create a meaningful name to integral values.

2. How can you modify an Enum?

You can modify an enum by changing the base type and assigning the value. 

3. How have you used Enums in your afternoon lab projects this far?(if you have not yet, give an example of how you could)

I haven't used enums in lab yet, but using them to for the categories on the checkpoint would've been a good idea.
