## Questions

1. What are lifecycle hooks? What are lifecycle hooks used for?

Lifecycle hooks allow you to know when a component is created, update, destroyed or added to the DOM. They are a window into how the library works under the hood. 

2. How have you utilized lifecycle hooks in your afternoon projects?

So far I've only used onMounted lifecycle hooks to render data on page load.

3. What are mounting hooks? When might you use them?

Mounted hooks gain you full access to the reactive component, templates, and the rendered DOM. You would use these hooks to render data that you want to see on page load.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

Honestly gregslist is such a great practice for any new content learned. This lab was when vue finally clicked for me. The repetition inherent in gregslist makes learning new ideas much more feasible.
