# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
Vue was a steep learning curve for me at the very beginning of the week, but I'm feeling a lot more confident with it now. I'm glad that we're going to continue to use vue for the remainder of the course, and I'm hoping to learn more about it's intricacies in the coming weeks. This checkpoint pushed a lot of my understandings of vue and made me try out new ideas, but overall I'm pleased with it's finished product.
