> **ðŸ“– [Callback Hell](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk4/01-Callbacks)**

## Questions

1. What are some of the signs and causes of `Callback Hell`?

Signs of 'Callback Hell' are multiple }) at the end and a pyramid shaped code. This is due to writing the function as executing from top to bottom. 

2. What does the asynchronous mean and how are callbacks involved?

Asynchronous means the the code will wait for a function to run until called. Callbacks are used to let the code know to wait until another function is done running and then run the callback function instead of running immediately. 

3. Summarize the 3 ways to avoid / fix `Callback Hell`

1-Keep your code shallow.
2-Modularize
3. Handle every single error

I've got so many questions...
