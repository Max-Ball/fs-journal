# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?

The MVC organization is such a huge help when writing JS. On Monday it was uncomfortable to use, but I'm really enjoying the multiple files that each have their purpose. 


This is a struggle and a victory - Whiteboard Wednesday was a definitely a struggle for me. I feel comfortable speaking in front of people and in interviews, but when put in front of a whiteboard and asked to solve a problem on the spot, my mind went completely blank. The victory is that I went up and did it in the first place, but I definitely want more practice doing them.
