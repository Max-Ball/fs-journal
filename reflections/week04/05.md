# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

This week was a bit of a mental challenge for me - It took me a couple days to even wrap my brain around requesting information from a server, let alone the code necessary to perform those requests. Once I was able to visualize the process though it became easier to understand. One takeaway from the week, and especially this checkpoint, was how little I know with CSS. I've relied on bootstrap for most styling, but predominately used css for this checkpoint. I watched a couple youtube videos and realized just how powerful css is. As for the async code and the mvc pattern - I'm feeling fairly confident on the process as well as being able to troubleshoot when server errors pop up.
