# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
This week closed out our Capstone project. It was such a great learning experience and I had a blast working with my team. I can't wait to continue working on this project in my spare time.
