## Questions

1. What technologies and principles are you using in your project?

Our group is using a mtg api to search cards and google maps api to show shops in your area that sell mtg cards.

2. What went well so far?

Our communication has been really good as far as notifying other group members with what we are doing or have done. 

3. What would you do differently? Why?

I would plan a little more with everybody's input before starting the project. It seemed like all of us had a rough idea of what the app should look like, and in the end everybody's vision made it into the app, but it was hard to envision what other people's ideas where at first.
