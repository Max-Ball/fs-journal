## Questions

1. What are the benefits of making a plan before starting to just write the code?

Making a plan before actually writing code helps solidify what the goal is and the necessary steps needed to achieve that goal. 

2. How do you find answers when you are stuck?

When I run into an issue that I haven't encountered before I will try and understand what is going on and try a few solutions. If those don't work I research the larger concept and then try and apply that to my code. 

3. From the entire article what are your biggest takeaways?

This line was my favorite takeaway "Do not think about programming as writing lines of code. Programming is a logic-based creativity that needs nurturing."

Getting to work with a partner on this assignment was fun. We were able to bounce ideas off each other and try things I wouldn't have thought of on my own.
