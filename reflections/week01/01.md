## Questions

1. In your own words, why do we use Git?

Git is a system that tracks and stores content. We can use Git to develop different versions of code and maintain a history of that code, or have multiple developers add code in parallel without affecting other versions. 

2. What are the benefits of having multiple branches?

Multiple branches are beneficial when multiple parallels of code are needed. Branches will not have an effect on other branches. 

3. What is the difference between Git and GitHub

Github is a remote repository that is used to push your local repository.
