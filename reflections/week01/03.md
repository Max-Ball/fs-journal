## Questions

1. What is your favorite tip that you think is the most beneficial to improving your design?

  Adding a vertical offset to a box shadow to emulate natural light reflection is a one of those small details that subconsciously makes your website look and feel better. 

2. Compile a couple resources that you think might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design ideas.

  1: https://open.spotify.com/ - Spotify makes great use of box shadows and defining primary/secondary/tertiary actions. They also use various color and weight for font for emphasis instead of just font size. 

  2: https://www.apple.com/ - For similar reasons Apple has a great design layout with a sleek look. The small break between white background pictures and a very light gray page background makes the website seamless, but not cluttered. The automated scroll bar of pictures is also real fancy. 


3. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?

It seems that a lot of good design decisions are the ones that no one thinks of or even needs to think about. At a base level good design will influence people by not making it frustrating to view the site they are wanting to visit. Good design will also convey exactly what the company or individual is wanting it to. Design is especially important for the branding and marketing aspects of both companies and individuals.
